Intro:

Since the amount of samples in a phylogenetics pipeline tend to be big, with many samples, a combination of FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and MultiQC (https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC) is a good way to go 
to easily check the quality of all samples and identify potential issues.
Note: I always organize my samples with sequential names having an acronym for the project I am working on, and numbers goind from 001 to NNN (i.e., for the project Eudaminae MacroWolbachia, a sample name would be EMW001). This helps a lot to run for and while loops, 
and to manipulate lists of files, samples, names, etc. BUT, it is very important to keep an organized metadata table at your local computer or server, so you a link between the sequencing name of the sample and the name you give them.

#################### FASTQC
## For FASTQC it is sufficient to have all your paired-reads in a single directory, named appropriately. I tend to always use full paths for my commands because of the way the submission to the cluster I use works.

#!/bin/bash

forward=/path/to/READSdirectory/file.R1.fastq
reverse=/path/to/READSdirectory/file.R2.fastq
OUTPUT=/path/to/OUTPUTdirectory

fastqc -o /path/to/OUTPUTdirectory/out_allFastQC $"forward" $"reverse"
